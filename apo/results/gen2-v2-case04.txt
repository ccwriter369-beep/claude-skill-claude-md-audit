| Error Handling | 16-20 | TRIM | Mixed: Keep error format and AppError class, remove generic advice |
| Data Model Conventions | 22-26 | KEEP | Compliance-driven: soft delete references HIPAA data retention, composite key is team-specific |
| Feature Flags | 28-31 | KEEP | Internal URL, specific naming convention, cannot be discovered from code |
| Third-Party Integrations | 33-36 | KEEP | Specific URLs, API versions, Vault references, internal paths |
