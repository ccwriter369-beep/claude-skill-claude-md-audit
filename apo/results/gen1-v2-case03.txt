| Section | Lines | Verdict | Reason |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| Monorepo Layout | 3-4 | KEEP | Non-obvious architectural constraint: monorepo structure and build tool choice cannot be discovered without reading multiple config files |
| Auth | 6-7 | KEEP | External integration context with team-specific authentication flow; internal service URL (auth.myco.io) not discoverable in code |
| Forbidden Actions | 9-12 | MOVE_HOOK | Hard NEVER/ALWAYS constraints are better enforced as PreToolUse hooks |
| Styling | 14-15 | TRIM | Framework choice (Tailwind) and config file locations are discoverable by reading tailwind.config.ts and packages/ui/tokens/ |
